            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 30, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <p>Welcome to ZenGuard! We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a transparent experience. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we keep it safe. Our goal is to collect the minimum amount of data necessary to provide and improve our service.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We have designed ZenGuard to function with minimal data collection. The information we handle can be broken down into two categories:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Locally Stored Data (On Your Computer)</h4>
        <p>This data is stored entirely on your local computer using the browser's built-in storage. We do not have access to this information, and it never leaves your machine unless you explicitly take action (like activating a license).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocklists & URLs:</strong> The lists of websites you create and the specific domains within them are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedules:</strong> Any focus schedules you create are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences for Pomodoro timers, notifications, and other features are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus Stats:</strong> Your focus streak, level, and garden data are all stored locally to track your progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h4>
        <p>We only collect Personally Identifiable Information when you voluntarily provide it to us in two specific situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Registration:</strong> When you register, we collect your <strong>Name, Nickname, and Email Address</strong>. This is used to personalize your experience and to notify our team of new user sign-ups via a secure Slack webhook.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium Activation:</strong> When you purchase ZenGuard Pro, you provide a <strong>License Key</strong>. We send this key to our payment processor, Gumroad, to verify its validity. We do not store your license key after verification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Core Functionality:</strong> Your blocklists and settings are used directly by the extension to block websites and manage timers as you've configured them.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve User Experience:</strong> Understanding how many users sign up helps us grow and improve the extension. Your email address allows us to potentially contact you with important updates or announcements in the future (we will always provide an opt-out option).</li>
            <li><strong>To Process Payments:</strong> Your license key is used for the one-time purpose of verifying your Pro purchase with Gumroad.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use a minimal number of trusted third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gumroad:</strong> Our payment processor for ZenGuard Pro. When you activate a license, we communicate with their API. You can view their privacy policy <a href="https://gumroad.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Slack:</strong> We use a secure webhook to receive a notification when a new user registers. This notification contains the name, nickname, and email you provided.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>All data stored locally on your machine is as secure as your computer itself. For the limited data transmitted (registration and license activation), we use secure, encrypted HTTPS connections. We do not store sensitive information like passwords or payment details on our servers.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights & Control</h2>
        <p>You are in full control of your data. You can view and delete your blocklists and schedules at any time from the extension's settings page. If you wish for your registration information (name, email) to be deleted from our notification records, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
